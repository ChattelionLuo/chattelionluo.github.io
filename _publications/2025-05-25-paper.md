excerpt: 'In this work, we study the learning theory of reward modeling with pairwise comparison data using deep neural networks. We establish a novel non-asymptotic regret bound for deep reward estimators in a non-parametric setting, which depends explicitly on the network architecture. Furthermore, to underscore the critical importance of clear human beliefs, we introduce a margin-type condition that assumes the conditional winning probability of the optimal action in pairwise comparisons is significantly distanced from 1/2. This condition enables a sharper regret bound, which substantiates the empirical efficiency of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and highlights clear human beliefs in its success. Notably, this improvement stems from high-quality pairwise comparison data implied by the margin-type condition, is independent of the specific estimators used, and thus applies to various learning algorithms and models.'

In this work, we study the learning theory of reward modeling with pairwise comparison data using deep neural networks. We establish a novel non-asymptotic regret bound for deep reward estimators in a non-parametric setting, which depends explicitly on the network architecture. Furthermore, to underscore the critical importance of clear human beliefs, we introduce a margin-type condition that assumes the conditional winning probability of the optimal action in pairwise comparisons is significantly distanced from 1/2. This condition enables a sharper regret bound, which substantiates the empirical efficiency of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and highlights clear human beliefs in its success. Notably, this improvement stems from high-quality pairwise comparison data implied by the margin-type condition, is independent of the specific estimators used, and thus applies to various learning algorithms and models.
