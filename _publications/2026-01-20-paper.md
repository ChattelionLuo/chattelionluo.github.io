excerpt: 'Do you follow the ATP tennis tour? Have you ever placed a bet at the race track? Who is the G.O.A.T.? Whether it’s ranking sports legends or training the latest Large Language Models (LLMs), the challenge is the same: how do we find the best when we cannot compare everyone against everyone?'

This article surveys recent progress in the Bradley--Terry (BT) model and its extensions. We focus on the statistical and computational aspects, with emphasis on the regime in which both the number of objects and the volume of comparisons tend to infinity—a setting relevant to large-scale applications. The main topics include asymptotic theory for statistical estimation and inference, along with the associated algorithms. We also discuss applications of these models, including recent work on preference alignment in machine learning. Finally, we discuss several key challenges and outline directions for future research.
