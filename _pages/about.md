I am a fresh Ph.D. student in the Department of Applied Mathematics at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I am fortunately supervised by [Dr. Ruijian Han](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/profile/rjhan/index.html) and [Prof. Jian Huang](https://sites.google.com/view/prof-jian-huang/bio?authuser=0). Prior to joining PolyU, I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics and Statistics from Hong Kong Baptist University in 2023 under the supervision of [Prof. Richard Xu](https://github.com/roboticcam). I am interested in statistical machine learning, reinforcement learning, and high-dimensional statistics.
