When not doing maths, I am a violinist. I learned from Mr. Xingyan Chen from [Sichuan Conservatory of Music](http://www.sccm.cn
). Currently, I am playing at the PolyU Orchestra under the baton of [Mr. Leung Kin-fung](http://www.leungkinfung.com/bio.php), and the ASO under the baton of [Mr. Chan Man Tat](https://acohk.org/#Conductor). I am a genuine classical music fan and playing in local/university orchestras, chamber groups, and studios. I was fortunate to cooperate with renowned musicians such as Alex Tam, Gordon Lee, Timothy Sun, Gigi Yim 炎明熹, Warren Mok, Dr Lunlun Zou, Dr. Vivian Cheng Wai, Ms Louise Kwong, etc. You can find some of my playings on stream.
