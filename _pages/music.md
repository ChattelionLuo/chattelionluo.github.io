When not doing maths, I am a semi-professional violinist. I learned from Mr. Xingyan Chen from [Sichuan Conservatory of Music](http://www.sccm.cn
). Currently, I am playing at the Asian Chamber Orchestra under the baton of Mr. Chan Man Tat. I am a genuine classical music fan and playing in local/university orchestras, chamber groups and studios. Please contact me if interested in collaborating.
