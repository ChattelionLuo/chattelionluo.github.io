When not doing maths, I play the violin. I learned from Mr. Xingyan Chen from [Sichuan Conservatory of Music](http://www.sccm.cn
) when I was a child. Currently, I am the Associate Concertmaster at PolyU Orchestra under the baton of [Mr. Leung Kin-fung](http://www.leungkinfung.com/bio.php). I am a genuine classical music fan, and playing in local/university orchestras, chamber groups, and studios. I was fortunate to play with renowned musicians such as Alex Tam, Gordon Lee, Timothy Sun, Gigi Yim 炎明熹, 张碧晨 Diamond, Warren Mok, Dr Lunlun Zou, Dr. Vivian Cheng Wai, Ms Louise Kwong, etc. You can find some of my plays on the stream.
